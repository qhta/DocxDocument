/// When there are one or more custom tab stops defined using the tabs element, 
/// then the tab character shall advance to the next custom tab stop location 
/// which is further along than the starting location of the tab.

/// When there are no custom tab stops which are further than the current position in the line, 
/// the tab character shall advance to the nearest multiple of the defaultTabStop element width value.
